# Colabs

Machine Learning Crash Course uses Colaboratories (Colabs) for all programming exercises. Colab is Google's implementation of [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). For more information about Colabs and how to use them, go to [Welcome to Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory).

# Linear Regression
In this Colab you will use a real dataset to train a model to predict the fare of a taxi ride in Chicago, Illinois.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this Colab, you'll be able to:

  * Read a .csv file into a [pandas](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#pandas) DataFrame.
  * Explore a [dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#data_set) with Python visualization libraries.
  * Experiment with different [features](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#feature) to build a linear regression model.
  * Tune the model's [hyperparameters](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#hyperparameter).
  * Compare training runs using [root mean squared error](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#root-mean-squared-error-rmse) and [loss curves](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#loss-curve).

## Dataset Description
The [dataset for this exercise](https://storage.mtls.cloud.google.com/mlcc-nextgen-internal/chicago_taxi_train.csv) is derived from the [City of Chicago Taxi Trips dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew). The data for this exercise is a subset of the Taxi Trips data, and focuses on a two-day period in May of 2022.
